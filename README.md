========

The output of `JSON.stringify` comes in two flavors: _compact_ and _pretty._ The
former is usually too compact to be read by humans, while the latter sometimes
is too spacious. This module trades performance (and the “replacer” argument)
for a compromise between the two. The result is a _pretty_ compact string, where
“pretty” means both “kind of” and “nice”.

```json
{
  "bool": true,
  "short array": [1, 2, 3],
  "long array": [
    {"x": 1, "y": 2},
    {"x": 2, "y": 1},
    {"x": 1, "y": 1},
    {"x": 2, "y": 2}
  ]
}
```

While the “pretty” mode of `JSON.stringify` puts every item of arrays and
objects on its own line, this module puts the whole array or object on a single
line, unless the line becomes too long (the default maximum is 80 characters).
Making arrays and objects multi-line is the only attempt made to enforce the
maximum line length; if that doesn’t help then so be it.


Installation
============

`npm install json-stringify-pretty-compact`

#### Node.js

```js
var stringify = require("json-stringify-pretty-compact")
```

#### Browser

```html
<script src="node_modules/json-stringify-pretty-compact/index.js">
```

Usage
=====

`stringify(obj, [options])`
---------------------------

It’s like `JSON.stringify(obj, null, options.indent)`, except that objects and
arrays are on one line if they fit (according to `options.maxLength`).

`options`:

- indent: Defaults to 2. Works exactly like the third parameter of
  `JSON.stringify`.
- maxLength: Defaults to 80. Lines will be tried to be kept at maximum this many
  characters long.

`stringify(obj, {maxLength: 0, indent: indent})` gives the exact same result as
`JSON.stringify(obj, null, indent)`.

`stringify(obj, {maxLength: Infinity})` gives the exact same result as
`JSON.stringify(obj)`, except that there are spaces after colons and commas.
